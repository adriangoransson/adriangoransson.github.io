        I'm a 21 year old software developer and network technician based outside Malmö, Sweden.

        My development focuses mainly on the web.
        I have experience with building RESTful APIs in PHP and Python backends.
        I've also built single page apps to communicate with said APIs using popular Javascript and CSS frameworks.

        Programming first started out as a hobby for me when studying network technology at school.
        Today I'm proud to be certified by Cisco with a CCNA.
        Being one of only two students at my school during my time there to receive the certification.
        Knowledge in routing, switching, firewalls and IPSec (VPN).

        I like flying, and my next goal is to take a private pilot's license which I'm currently studying for.

                Beepsend is an SMS company specializing in ATP (application to peer) messaging.\\

                Single page apps built with Chaplin js and Bootstrap using Coffeescript and LESS.

                I've worked with the internal and public APIs that are made in PHP using the Slim framework,
                Redis for caching and MySQL + MySQL Cluster as a database backend.
                RabbitMQ is used for instant messaging and a socket server written in
                Python brings instant updates to the frontend via Websockets.

                Network administrations work has included setting up IPSec VPNs towards clients
                using the software OpenSwan on Linux servers.\\
                I've also set up and maintained Beepsend's SMSC and STP as well as the SS7 and SIGTRAN
                connections that connects to some of the worlds biggest signaling providers
                in order to provide cheap and reliable messaging.
